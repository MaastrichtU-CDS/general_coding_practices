Introduction of R

R (https://www.r-project.org/) is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
R is a system for data manipulation, statistical and numerical analysis, and graphical display.
Runs under Windows, MacOS, Unix/Linux, and even on Android (and with some tricks also on iOS)
Why R? Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman

Modes of interacting with R
-Interactively: type commands into the R console andget immediate feedback
• to use R as a “calculator on speed”
• useful for spontaneous exploration of data
• to test parts of a script file
-via script files: type commands into a script file and then do one of the following:
• copy-paste commands to execute into the R console
• read in and execute commands with source()
• batch processing (source file from command line)

Via scripts
• organized programming/analyses
• code sharing and reuse
• increases replicability
• can write/edit script files with:
• built-in editor
• external editor
• integrated development environment (IDE)
R studio
• RStudio: an IDE for R
• open source (commercial version also available)
• runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (also via web)
• some of the useful features:
• syntax highlighting
• code completion
• bracket matching
• object list and command history
• organized workspace (editor, console, plots)
